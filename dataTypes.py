Python Data types
a. Python is a dynamically typed language; hence we do not need to define the type of the variable while declaring it.
b. for example, in the code below, the variable 'a' holds the value '2' and the type was not defined.

Standard data types
the data type defined in python are as follows:
1. Numbers
2. Sequence Type
3. Boolean
4. Set
5. Dictionary
It can be represented under these categories:
Text Type:	str
Numeric Types:	int, float, complex
Sequence Types:	list, tuple, range
Mapping Type:	dict
Set Types:	set, frozenset
Boolean Type:	bool
Binary Types:	bytes, bytearray, memoryview
None Type:	NoneType

the data type of an object can be obtained by using the 'type()' function
"""

a = 5
print(a)

x = 5
print(type(x))
